  DOM is using event propagation so when event is fired on all elements where define in it path up to the root element
  So if:
    &lt;element-1&gt;
      &lt;element-2&gt;
        &lt;element-3&gt;
  if element-3 event is firing then its goes up to element-2 and well as element-3.  

  To stop this propagation use in the component event handler:
  <code>
    onClick($event) 	&#123;
      event.stopPropagation;
    &#125;
  </code>
